# Getting started with Earthquakes

## Technology overview

Building an app to download, decode, and present data from a network data source.

Customized decoding — Swift has built-in data decoding features that automate common decoding tasks and simplify complex ones.

Concurrent design — Language features like asynchronous functions, tasks, and actors make writing asynchronous and concurrent code almost as straightforward as writing synchronous code.

Safety from data races — Concurrent programming often comes with hard-to-debug errors, such as data races. Swift actors help you easily avoid this type of error.

Testable components — Network operations can be difficult to test. Generics are a way to decouple dependencies and improve your app’s testability.

Integration with SwiftUI — SwiftUI has the tools to keep your user interface in sync with an asynchronous data source.
